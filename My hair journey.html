    <h1>Hair journey</h1>
    <p>I officialy joined the natural hair community in 2017 when i was in
      grade 7 when i started being aware,learning how my hair is and therfore
      how to take care of it.So throughout my 5 year rollercoaster journey i
      have gone through horrible damage and breakage, 1 big chop ,thinning of
      hair and a whole lot more which i can probably write a book on
      (excuse the hyperbole).Even though ive had my downs i have aalso had my
      highs where my hair was flourishing , healthy and Frothentic to the point
      where my friends and family would alwasys ask me to help them by giving
      them tips and advice in how to take care of their hair so that it can
      become healthy and be able to retain length.So be optamistic and
      enjoy YOUR journey and its stages.</p>
