         <h1>Type of hair</h1>
             <p>So there's three types of porositys that determine your hair types and in
              my opinoin porosity is one of the most important factors that can
             influence how one can have healthy hair hence ,for now , i am not going
             to go into types of curls or kinks eg.4c,3b etc hair.Porosity is your
             hairs ability to absorb and retain moisture.
             If you have low porosity your hair doesnt absorb product easily.
             Medium porosity hair doesnt take long to dry, it takes colour well etc.
             High porosity hair tends to break easily and fizzy or dry.</p>
